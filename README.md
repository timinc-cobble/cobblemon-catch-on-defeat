# Catch on Defeat

v1.6-1.5.0

## What if…

…Pokémon could be captured when defeated, instead of via PokéBall?

## Features

- Spawn specific Pokémon that can be defeated in order to be caught, or set it so that everybody can be “caught” this way.
- Optional confirmation screen when a defeated Pokémon wants to join your team.
- Optionally heal Pokémon that join the party through this mechanic.
- Optionally prevent regular captures, and make it so that Pokémon must be “caught” this way.
- Optionally connect/disconnect individual events regarding the joins, including capture for accepted join and release for rejected joins.

## Dependencies

- [Cobblemon](https://www.notion.so/Cobblemon-22157e0d4afd80a49896c70a775a3c7f?pvs=21)
- [Cobblemon Tim Core](https://www.notion.so/Tim-Core-22057e0d4afd809b9c02e78f26805376?pvs=21)
- [owo Lib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)

## Testing

With access to commands, run the following command in your world:

`/pokespawn aipom catch_on_defeat=yes`

Then, try throwing any old type of PokeBall at the Aipom that was spawned. By default, it will refuse to be caught and give you a feedback message saying you must defeat it to catch it. Get into battle with it, beat it up until it faints, and it’ll join your team (healed, by default).

## Known Issues

- As this uses Cobblemon Tim Core’s custom Pokémon properties logic, there is a known issue where loading up the first world in a single player session will not show the autocomplete for the custom Pokémon properties in commands. The property still works, it’s just the autocomplete that’s weird.
